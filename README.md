# Script and data from: "A High-Resolution Gridded Dataset to Assess Electrification in Sub-Saharan Africa"

This repository hosts:

 - A JavaScript file to be imported into Google Earth Engine (step 1)
 - A R script to be run after having run the JavaScript file in Earth Engine (step 2)
 - Supporting files to run the analysis (e.g. a shapefile of provinces)
 - Two ncdf4 files containg the data output of the analyis
      - One reporting the number of people without access in each grid cell between 2014 and 2018
      - The other reporting the consumption tier in each populated, electrified cell in 2018
      
 In order to replicate the analysis, the following steps are required:
 
- Create a Google account, if you do not have one, and make a request for Earth Engine access via https://signup.earthengine.google.com.
- Make sure your Google Drive has enough free cloud storage space.
- Either obtain access to the LandScan population data by applying for an account (https://landscan.ornl.gov/user/apply), or use the WorldPop data, which is accessible from the script in this repository without further steps.
- Download the JavaScipt and R scripts and the supporitng files hosted at https://github.com/giacfalk/Electrification_SSA_data
- Run the JavaScript file in Google Earth Engine
- Download the supporting files along with the R script
- Run the R script, which reproduce the analysis, plots contained in the paper, and the output ncdf4 files.

Source code-related issues should be opened directly on GitHub. Broader questions of the methods should be addressed to giacomo.falchetta@feem.it
